#Dotfiles

My [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) dot files 
repository. Homesick is a neat way to keep config and preference files in-sync
across a number of machines. The basic functionality is achieved by creating
[symlinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) in your home directory
to files within a homesick repository, which typically exist in `~/.homesick/`.

##Vim

##Bash

##Git
My [.gitconfig](home/.gitconfig) is pretty standard, with colours enabled and
my user-details provided. I specify my global [.gitignore](home/.gitignore) file
explicitly, and also enable KeyChain authentication on OS X.

My [.gitignore](home/.gitignore) is pretty basic, with all logs, packages,
bundles, executables and OS-generated meta-files ignored. I occasionally add
files to this as I change my tooling.
