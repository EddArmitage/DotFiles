dotfiles
========

My [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) dot files repository.

#Vim

#Bash

#Git
My `.gitconfig` is pretty standard, with colours enabled and my user-details
provided. I specify my global `.gitignore` file explicitly, and also enable
KeyChain authentication on OS X.

My `.gitignore` is pretty basic, with all logs, packages, bundles, executables
and OS-generated meta-files ignored. I occasionally add files to this as I
change my tooling.
